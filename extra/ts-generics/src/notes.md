- Abstractions:
  - Need intermeditate and advanced Typescript to make the abstraction feel powerful.
  - Use TS to fullest self ,without having to annotate code.

- Abstractions can be force multipliers for a team.
- Where these generics and advanced TS concepts really start to shine where we build code for writing code.
- Probably can figure out what our code means, if not for really advanced things.

- if we can refactor something to a standard type, you should.

- TS wants to understadn what your JS code is doing and it has limits, and these allow the flow to be much better represented.
