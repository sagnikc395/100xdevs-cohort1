- Notes:
  - Install Nodejs, join Discord and go to #warm-up.
  - Fullstack helped to move careers and move from one things to other.
  - Most used stack for remote developers and helped people get jobs.
  - Small batches , better community.
  - Pre-Requisites:
    - Javascript Video :- Most hammani and learn the Javascript basics.
    - Pace of the Course:
      - Structure of the course beginner friendly 
      - contribute to open source project and do that 
      - easy and hard assignments.
      - learn to be productive and do hard things.
  - You have chat-gpt and 100+ mern stack tutorials 
  - goal is to not just learn mernstack :- become the 1% of the class and studying ahead of the class and build on top of open source.
  - stay on top of toes and already know stuff.
  - Mentor :- guide to know ; not to teach you everyhting from scratch; do on your own.
  - **Fundamentals will differentiate good developers**
    - ChatGPT already here , if known good developers then can use to build basic things and build on top of boilerplate.
    - Need to use to intern effectively and to learn the fundamentals right to build on top of these things.
    - Once fundamentals are good, then can offload things on it.
  - Simple assignments and do hard todos.
  - Do Stuff on ourselves.

- **Goal**
  - To become independent coders.
  - Become a 10x engineer , problem statement, new stack (if new) and they are independent workers.
  - Become the agility and dont follow.
  - Be on your toes and run ahead of the class and create projects already and do assignemnts.
  - Learn hustles and have skills during the bull run.
  - A new breakthorugh tech comes, requires engineer and aim to reach the skill level of full stack developer.
  - Hustle and base level is what we need to understand.
  - Basics -> Advanced (learn advanced things on our own.)

- Open Source Approach :
  - Top down approach on companies that are hiring and their open source codebase.
  - 10 hours on the week easy enough to contribute.
  
- Advice for passouts:
  - Grind through out the course 

- No rocket science and lots of hustling.
- Remote Job Tip: Arbitrage in companies (india is cheaper); US everyhting so expensive; have to make ends meet. ~20lakh enough for base lifestyle.
- Cna provide same value , as someone with 50-60k$ sde in us.
- Do projects, understand technology and network and build value.
- Focus on project based learning.
- Dont create notes and do a lot of projects and you are good to go.
- Approach CTO not recruiters in remote jobs.
- Age , region and face, college dont matter in remote. And code benefit in GSOC. only contributions matter.
- Freelance -> get skills and clients -> build products and then get into remote work.
