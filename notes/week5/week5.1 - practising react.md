- need to move over this bump is react and understanding the great start. we incrementally build up and is a good starting point.
- in react there are components:
	- defining our own html tags.
	- effectively created our new HTML tag which returns the html stored .
	- Components are used to abstract a lot of HTML together.
- can send data to components and also used it inside our components.



- vw -> complete view width 
- vh -> complete view height 

### flexbox:
	- common thing to keep things in center.
	- basically to position things to various positions of the screen.
	- also requires some grasping.
	- divs take by default whole width, span can be used.
	- real world to restrict the width of things using flexbox.
	- know elemnts shouldnt take full width , use flexbox.
	- the parent div , give display: flex , to introduce flexbox.
	- justify-center
		- if start ; then everyhting appears at the start.
		- if end ; then eveyrhting appears at the end.
		- space-between ; 3 elemetns equi spaced.
 - if we have added flex to a parent doesnt mean its gradnchild also will have that, check the most immediate parent tag property. only works in 1 level.
