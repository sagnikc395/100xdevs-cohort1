- how big projects are structured and how to re-use packages
	- multiple parts
	- backend,
	- types and common utilities.
	- multiple frontends
	- generally a single Github repo, contain in the same repo.
	- have multiple modules in our repos.
- before monorepos:
	- why packages / modules ?
		- reusable code
		- people use to shove their repos together in different folders.
		- or different repos for client and server code.
		- npm workspaces made it easier to have client and server code and import code between each other.
	- multiple modules in our repo.
- cal.com:
	- has a bunch of folders 
	- most important things happen in packages and apps folder.
	- apps:
		- has modules 
		- directories.
		- modules are reusable code and seperation of concerns -> each module does what it is supposed to do.
		- emails, onboards etc. -> teams can work independently on modules.
	- breaking big app into small modules.
- zod inference:
	- can make backend code safer by doing input validation and protect from attacks.
	- if the schema changes in the input, then we would have to change the schema in 2 places.
	- given the zod object , can you change the zod inference to typescript without writing additional code.
			- yes ! ; call using types z.infer.
	- trying to write reusable code that can be written in both frontend and backend.
